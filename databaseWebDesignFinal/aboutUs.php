Her Italian grandparents instilled in her that food brings everyone together; it's a time to share and enjoy with those you love. She has always been an adventerous eater, and you can always find her on the hunt for a delish restaurant! Cooking became more of a hobby for her during the pandemic, and she has continued to grow her repetoire since then. "I can't wait to see this website build an even bigger foodie community!", she says.</h2>

People would tell stories about my brother and I cracking open crab shells and having a very diverse pallete from a young age. Every holiday growing up was surrounded my food, and good food too. It brought my joy to my family putting their heart into the meals served. This is a great opportunity to share this joy with the world!"</h2>
