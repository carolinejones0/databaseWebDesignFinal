    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <h2> This is a space where you can share your recipes and we can share ours!<h2>
    <p class = "about"> <img  src="Cs148 Final Photots/foood.jpeg"> </p>
    <p> We came up with this idea when we were all expressing our love for food. This passion created a need for a place where we can share our favorite food experiences through recipes. All three of The Recepie Achives creators come from different places in the United States however, we all share a love for great authentic recipes that you can find on this website. </p>
    <p> We hope that our Gallery & Recipe pages will inspire the little chef in you and encourage you to submit your own favorite recipe for someone else to see! </p>
